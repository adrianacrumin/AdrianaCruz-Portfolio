at the results of the MDS plot using 1/Lift, brands that seem closely associated are Volvo, Infiniti, Cadillac, Acura, and Audi. Brands that appear distinguished from the rest include Lexus, BMW, and Ford. This implies that due to strong brand similiarity that there would be lower switching costs between Volvo, Infinity & Cadillac, compared to Lexus and Ford. Another interesting note is that brands seem to be clustered regionally, where we can see Asian/European brands have more similiarities for consumers compared to American brands which would be more distinct from each other.\n","\n","The lift matrix shows that Lexus has relatively low lift values across the board. This means that Lexus is not highly associated with other brands. When we consider the word frequencies of Lexus (8341), it is nearly 4x larger than the 2nd most frequently-mentioned brand. This means Lexus shows up in most of the comments on the forum, so it's more independent of the other brands. It shows up regardless which other brands are mentioned in the post. Because of this high frequency of mentions and weak association with other brands, Lexus seems to be the most popular and distinguished \"entry-level luxury brand.\"\n","\n","On the other hand, brands like Cadillac, Volvo, and Infiniti are in the center of the MDS plot. The lift matrix also shows that these 3 brands have high associations with each other and with other brands in general. The marginal probability of any one of these brands showing up in a post is less than 6%, whereas Lexus is over 59%. These low marginal probabilities show that although Cadillac, Volvo, and Infiniti don't show up often, when they ARE mentioned, they are highly likely to show up in the same post as many other brands. These 3 brands seem to be good points of comparison to other cars on the forum.\n","\n","Luxury is a subjective topic that varies between consumers, we can see using the matrix and visually the MDS map that there are clusters that show some similiarties between what we typically consider luxury and non-luxury brands.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a60ef205-216d-4727-a4c4-fd52f4614641","metadata":{"id":"a60ef205-216d-4727-a4c4-fd52f4614641"},"source":["# Count Attribute

Overall, it seems that Audi and Infiniti have the highest associations with the selected attributes as demonstrated by the higher average lift values. This is makes sense conceptually since both of these are luxury brands, and the forum we scraped the data from is for \"entry-level luxury brands.\" We did expect to see that these 5 attributes are associated with the luxury cars.\n","\n","One interesting callout is that Ford has a considerably high association with the word \"luxury.\" Ford & Honda both have higher \"average\" lift values than traditional luxury brands like Cadilac & Lexus. We can see that one of the strongest differentiator between each brand also comes with a shortfall, such as with Honda, Volvo & Kia where they average highly in safety but drop in power and performance. While Lexus is mediocre and needs to establish some sort of value proposition that would boost its reputation. We see with Cadillac has a high association with luxury but extremely low association with safety, engine & power. We would recommend that they build back their reputation to gain back the confidence from their consumers within these attributes for entry-level luxury.\n","\n","Acura have a rare opportunity to focus its efforts within power and/or safety to begin competing stronger with other brands that are well established, we mention this because Acura has good qualities across the board. If they are able to establish a strong dominance over a specific attribute then they would have a higher average overall in brand perception."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b10523c1-c5f0-448e-8ac8-f33115b54f6b","metadata":{"id":"b10523c1-c5f0-448e-8ac8-f33115b54f6b"},"source":["### Task G: Aspirational"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"75679d54-e849-4f0e-919c-5743b7e8e36e","metadata":{"id":"75679d54-e849-4f0e-919c-5743b7e8e36e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739333481667,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":83,"user":{"displayName":"Terril Gibson","userId":"12720411229118544590"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import string\n","import re\n","from collections import Counter\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"id":"ea3add6b-1d50-4708-8d0c-a61a599fc72a","metadata":{"id":"ea3add6b-1d50-4708-8d0c-a61a599fc72a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739333481667,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":83,"user":{"displayName":"Terril Gibson","userId":"12720411229118544590"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#We chose these phrases because of the initial count of attributes and since they would be good given the context within the sentence.\n","aspirational_phrases = [\n","    \"i wish i could buy\",\n","    \"i wish i had\",\n","    \"i wish that i\",\n","    \"i wish my\",\n","    \"i wish that my\",\n","    \"ive always wanted\",\n","    \"im saving up for\",\n","    \"one day i want to\",\n","    \"if only i had\",\n","    \"i would love to\",\n","    \"i want to get\",\n","    \"if i could get\",\n","    \"im so jealous\",\n","    \"if only i could\",\n","    \"should be more like\",\n","    \"could be more like\",\n","    \"my dream car\",\n","    \"my goal\",\n","    \"my aspiration\",\n","    \"work my way up to\",\n","    \"i have got to get\",\n","    \"ive got to\",\n","    \"looking around for a\",\n","    \"I dreamed i could\",\n","    \"ive always dreamed of\",\n","    \"saving up for\"]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"id":"e1b9bc05-b6bd-4a8e-85a5-e23c0b17a63c","metadata":{"id":"e1b9bc05-b6bd-4a8e-85a5-e23c0b17a63c","outputId":"17dc6964-1137-45f2-95c7-70a779cd8c53","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739333482279,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":695,"user":{"displayName":"Terril Gibson","userId":"12720411229118544590"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Most Aspirational Brand: bmw (Lift = 2.69)\n"]}],"source":["def preprocess_text(text):\n","    text = str(text).lower()\n","    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n","    return text\n","\n","# Function to check if a comment contains an aspirational phrase\n","def contains_aspirational_phrase(comment):\n","    comment = preprocess_text(comment)\n","    for phrase in aspirational_phrases:\n","        if phrase in comment:\n","            return True\n","    return False\n","\n","# Apply preprocessing\n","df['cleaned_comment'] = df['Comment'].apply(preprocess_text)\n","\n","# Identify aspirational comments\n","df['aspirational'] = df['cleaned_comment'].apply(lambda x: 1 if contains_aspirational_phrase(x) else 0)\n","\n","# Function to extract brands (after detecting aspirational phrases)\n","def extract_brands(text):\n","    words = text.split()\n","    brands = [model_to_brand_dict[word] for word in words if word in model_to_brand_dict]\n","    return brands\n","\n","# Get brands from aspirational comments\n","df['aspirational_brands'] = df[df['aspirational'] == 1]['cleaned_comment'].apply(extract_brands)\n","\n","# Flatten the list of brands mentioned in aspirational comments\n","aspirational_brands = [brand for sublist in df['aspirational_brands'].dropna() for brand in sublist]\n","\n","# Count the most frequently mentioned brands in aspirational comments\n","aspirational_brand_counts = Counter(aspirational_brands)\n","\n","# Find the most aspirational brand\n","most_aspirational_brand = aspirational_brand_counts.most_common(1)[0]\n","\n","# **Step 4: Calculate Probabilities**\n","total_comments = len(df)\n","\n","# P(Aspirational) -
