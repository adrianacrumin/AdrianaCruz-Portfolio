## Is the Messi Effect Real?  
**A Player-Driven Instagram Engagement Analysis of Inter Miami CF**
---
When Lionel Messi joined Inter Miami, the internet exploded. The club’s Instagram account reportedly gained millions of followers overnight — but how much does that hype *actually* translate into engagement today?

This passion project explores how individual players influence post performance on Inter Miami's Instagram. Using scraped image posts and engagement metrics, I’m analyzing which players consistently drive likes, comments, and attention — and how big of a difference Messi makes compared to his teammates.
